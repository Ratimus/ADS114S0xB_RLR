Data Read Command
RDATA       Read data by command            0001 001x (12h / 13h)(1)          —
Register Read and Write Commands
RREG        Read nnnnn registers starting   001r rrrr(2)                000n nnnn(3)
                at address rrrrr
WREG        Write nnnnn registers starting  010r rrrr(2)                000n nnnn(3)
                at address rrrrr

1. x = don't care
2. r rrrr = starting register address
3. n nnnn = number of registers to read or write - 1

Commands can be sent at any time, either during a conversion or when conversions are stopped. However, if
register read or write commands are in progress when conversion data are ready, the ADC blocks loading of
conversion data to the output shift register. The CS input pin can be taken high between commands; or held low
between consecutive commands. CS must stay low for the entire command sequence. Complete the command,
or terminate the command before completion by taking CS high. Only send the commands that are listed in
Table 24.
