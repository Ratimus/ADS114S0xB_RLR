Objectives:

For an ADS114S0xB:

Bare metal device driver that can:
 - initialize the device
 - valid read/write SPI (really? why not a separate driver for SPI? Dependency injection is good)
 - ability to read/write all the registers on the device
 - read valid ADC values from device

User-space application that uses your driver to:
 - read ADC values
 - read register values
 - change ADC channels

evaluated based on:
1. Communication
2. Documentation
3. Code Cleanliness
4. Code Deployment
5. Testing
